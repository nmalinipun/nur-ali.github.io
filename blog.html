      <h3>üåç New Beginnings: My First Step into American Academic Life</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 22, 2023 | <strong>Author:</strong> Nur Mohammad Ali</p>
        <img src="IMG_8049.jpg" alt="Nur Mohammad Ali on Plane" />
        <p>On January 22, 2023, I landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, at 7:00 PM. That moment changed my life. As I stepped off the plane, the first thing I saw was the glowing sign ‚Äî <strong>‚ÄúWelcome to Houston.‚Äù</strong></p>
        <p>Though excited, I faced a small challenge at immigration. My classes had already started on January 17th, and the officer took me to a separate room. Thankfully, I had a <strong>late arrival permission letter</strong> from my university. After reading it, the officer smiled and welcomed me warmly. I realized how important it is for F1 students to carry all necessary documents.</p>
        <p>My good friend Richard from <strong>JCI</strong> came all the way to pick me up. A true gentleman with a kind heart, he dropped me off at my new apartment, <strong>The Edge in Beaumont</strong>. It was a four-bedroom apartment shared with six Bangladeshi roommates. We were all excited to start our first semester together!</p>
        <img src="IMG_8083.jpg" alt="Houston Airport" />
        <p>The very next day, I had my first meal at the <strong>Catholic Student Center</strong>. It was delicious, but even more heartwarming was meeting <strong>Father Rodel</strong>. His generosity and hospitality reminded me of home. That experience became a symbol of kindness in my new journey.</p>

        <img src="IMG_8121.jpg" alt="Father Rodel" />
        <p>I started this journey as an <strong>F1 student</strong>, and I carry with me not just dreams, but deep gratitude for every person who supported me.</p>

        <p>To all new international students ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry if things feel overwhelming. Keep your documents ready, accept help with an open heart, and most of all ‚Äî believe in your journey.</p>

      <h3>üéì Bridging Cultures in the Classroom: School Visit in Beaumont</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 21, 2025 | <strong>Author:</strong> Nur Mohammad Ali</p>
        <img src="67bebddb-a475-4ba4-926c-052d495cb963.png" alt="School Campus Entrance" />
        <p>I had the wonderful opportunity to visit All Saints Episcopal School in Beaumont, Texas, as a guest speaker. The visit was part of a cultural education initiative, and I was invited by Deacon Tracie Middleton, the school‚Äôs Chaplain.</p>
        <p>As an international doctoral student from Bangladesh, this was my first time stepping into an American school as a presenter. I felt both honored and nervous. But from the moment I arrived, I was welcomed with warmth, respect, and curiosity from both students and staff. That openness made me feel truly seen and appreciated.</p>
        <img src="a6119f08-a1a2-453f-aed7-37d87d30137e.png" alt="Inside the Auditorium" />
        <p>The experience wasn‚Äôt just about giving a talk. It was about exchanging stories and traditions. I had the chance to share my own beliefs and background, and I also learned from others who spoke about theirs. The students were so attentive, and their questions showed genuine interest in the world beyond their own.</p>
        <img src="77b4c77a-115c-4654-879f-4ca3a1b3c730.png" alt="Classroom and Garden Area" />
        <p>Walking around campus, I was amazed by their creative classroom setups, the vibrant auditorium, and even the vegetables growing in the school garden. At one moment, I jokingly wished I could be a student there myself!</p>
        <p>This visit left a strong impact on me. It reminded me how important cultural exposure is in shaping open-minded, respectful future leaders. I‚Äôm grateful for this experience, and I hope to visit more schools to share and learn even more.</p>
