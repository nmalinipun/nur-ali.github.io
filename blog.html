      <h3>üåç New Beginnings: My First Step into American Academic Life</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">

        <p>On January 22, 2023, I landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, at 7:00 PM. That moment changed my life. As I stepped off the plane, the first thing I saw was the glowing sign ‚Äî <strong>‚ÄúWelcome to Houston.‚Äù</strong></p>
        <p>Though excited, I faced a small challenge at immigration. My classes had already started on January 17th, and the officer took me to a separate room. Thankfully, I had a <strong>late arrival permission letter</strong> from my university. After reading it, the officer smiled and welcomed me warmly.</p>
        <p>My good friend Richard from <strong>JCI</strong> came all the way to pick me up. A true gentleman with a kind heart, he dropped me off at my new apartment, <strong>The Edge in Beaumont</strong>. We were all excited to start our first semester together!</p>
        <img src="IMG_8083.jpg" alt="Houston Airport" />
        <p>I had my first meal at the <strong>Catholic Student Center</strong> and met <strong>Father Rodel</strong>. His generosity and hospitality reminded me of home.</p>

        <img src="IMG_8121.jpg" alt="Father Rodel" />
        <p>I started this journey as an <strong>F1 student</strong>, and I carry with me not just dreams, but deep gratitude for every person who supported me.</p>
        <img src="IMG_8124.jpg" alt="First Meal in USA" />
        <p>To all new international students ‚Äî believe in your journey.</p>

        üéì Bridging Cultures in the Classroom: School Visit in Beaumont
      </h3>
      <div class="blog-content">

        <p>I had the wonderful opportunity to visit All Saints Episcopal School in Beaumont, Texas, as a guest speaker. I was invited by Deacon Tracie Middleton, the school‚Äôs Chaplain.</p>
        <p>This was my first time stepping into an American school as a presenter. I felt honored and nervous. But I was welcomed warmly and respectfully by students and staff.</p>

        <img src="IMG_1461.jpg" alt="Presentation in progress with projector screen" />
        <p>I shared stories, traditions, and answered students' questions. Their curiosity was inspiring and sincere.</p>
        <img src="IMG_1480.JPG" alt="Conversation with students outside in the field" />
        <p>Walking around campus, I was amazed by creative setups, garden space, and overall atmosphere. I jokingly wished I could be a student there too!</p>
        <p>This visit reminded me how impactful cultural exchange can be for developing respectful, open-minded future leaders.</p>
