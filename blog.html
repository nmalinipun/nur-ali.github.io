      <h3>üåç New Beginnings: My First Step into American Academic Life</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">

        <p>On January 22, 2023, I landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, at 7:00 PM. That moment changed my life. As I stepped off the plane, the first thing I saw was the glowing sign ‚Äî <strong>‚ÄúWelcome to Houston.‚Äù</strong></p>

        <p>Though excited, I faced a small challenge at immigration. My classes had already started on January 17th, and the officer took me to a separate room. Thankfully, I had a <strong>late arrival permission letter</strong> from my university. After reading it, the officer smiled and welcomed me warmly. I realized how important it is for F1 students to carry all necessary documents.</p>

        <p>My good friend Richard from <strong>JCI</strong> came all the way to pick me up. A true gentleman with a kind heart, he dropped me off at my new apartment, <strong>The Edge in Beaumont</strong>. It was a four-bedroom apartment shared with six Bangladeshi roommates. We were all excited to start our first semester together!</p>

        <p>The very next day, I had my first meal at the <strong>Catholic Student Center</strong>. It was delicious, but even more heartwarming was meeting <strong>Father Rodel</strong>. His generosity and hospitality reminded me of home. That experience became a symbol of kindness in my new journey.</p>

        <p>I started this journey as an <strong>F1 student</strong>, and I carry with me not just dreams, but deep gratitude for every person who supported me.</p>

        <p>To all new international students ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry if things feel overwhelming. Keep your documents ready, accept help with an open heart, and most of all ‚Äî believe in your journey.</p>
