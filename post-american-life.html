          <p>On January 22, 2023, I landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, at 7:00 PM. That moment changed my life. As I stepped off the plane, the first thing I saw was the glowing sign ‚Äî <strong>‚ÄúWelcome to Houston.‚Äù</strong></p>
          <p>Though excited, I faced a small challenge at immigration. My classes had already started on January 17th, and the officer took me to a separate room. Thankfully, I had a <strong>late arrival permission letter</strong> from my university. After reading it, the officer smiled and welcomed me warmly.</p>
          <p>My good friend Richard from <strong>JCI</strong> came all the way to pick me up. A true gentleman with a kind heart, he dropped me off at my new apartment, <strong>The Edge in Beaumont</strong>. We were all excited to start our first semester together!</p>

          <p>I had my first meal at the <strong>Catholic Student Center</strong> and met <strong>Father Rodel</strong>. His generosity and hospitality reminded me of home.</p>

          <p>I started this journey as an <strong>F1 student</strong>, and I carry with me not just dreams, but deep gratitude for every person who supported me.</p>

          <p>To all new international students ‚Äî believe in your journey.</p>
