    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Nur Mohammad Ali, a Doctoral Engineering student at Lamar University. My journey began in Bangladesh, where I cultivated a strong foundation in engineering and business through my BS in Electrical Engineering and MBA in Marketing. My curiosity and ambition brought me to the United States to explore how advanced technologies can transform global supply chains.</p>

    <p>I specialize in forecasting, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality, with applications in supply chain optimization, smart manufacturing, and air transportation systems. My recent research on hierarchical demand forecasting, optimized regression models, and fuzzy logic has demonstrated measurable accuracy improvements that could benefit industry operations and national infrastructure.</p>

    <p>My goal is to design scalable, AI-powered solutions that help reduce waste, improve resiliency, and support critical logistics for the U.S. economy. I believe in blending academic excellence with real-world impact—both through my research and my personal experiences traveling across America, from the vibrant coasts of California to the heart of Texas.</p>

    <p>I am passionate about connecting data and people, exploring innovation through immersive technologies like AR/VR, and building systems that matter—not just in labs, but in factories, airports, and communities across the country.</p>
